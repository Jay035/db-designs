Although social media has made it easier for people to connect with each other, it has also made it easier to maintain surface-level relationships without ever meeting face-to-face. In turn, this has contributed to a decline in community building, networking, and the development of real connections.",

When individuals meet in person, they can share experiences, thoughts, and emotions that are difficult to convey through digital means. In-person interactions also provide an opportunity for non-verbal communication, which can often convey more than words alone. Generally, physical interaction creates room for individuals to establish trust, empathy, and a deeper understanding of one another, which is essential for building long-lasting relationships.",
